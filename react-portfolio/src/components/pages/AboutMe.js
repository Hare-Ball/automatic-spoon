        <p>My name is Robert Hare. I am an aspiring web developer in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.
        I hold a Bachelor of Arts from Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas and Web Development Certificate from SMU.
        In addition to being a web developer, I am also an educator and public speaker, and life-long learner.
        In my spare time, I am an avid poetry connoisseur, which led me to create, host, and produce the Preaching Poetry Podcast.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite poems is "The Builders" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. His immortal words inspire me in my work: </p>    
            <ul>
                <li>"Nothing useless is, or low;</li>
                <li>Each thing in its place is best;</li>
                <li>And what seems but idle show</li>
                <li>Strengthens and supports the rest.</li>
                <li>For the structure that we raise,</li>
                <li>Time is with materials filled;</li>
                <li>Our to-days and yesterdays</li>
                <li>Are the blocks with which we build."</li>
              </ul>
        </div>
